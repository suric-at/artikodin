  # request pull request. The base branch needs to at least contain
  # up to date github workflows to handle the pull request reviews.

  # Configure the format that the exception request branches will
  # take. This needs to contain {repository} and {pr_num} in order
  # to extract the repository (which will be stored in full, org/name
  # format) and pull request number of the exception request
  branch_format: exception-request/{repository}/{pr_num}

# Configure the commit statuses
status:
  # Configure the commit status context that will be used for the

  # and only used by the controller.
  context: freeze

# Configure the active windows
windows:
  # Configure the name of the base branch used to keep track of the
  # currently active freeze windows. If this branch does not exist,
  # it will automatically be created with a root, empty commit.

  # Configure the format that the active windows branches will take.
  # This needs to contain {freeze_window_id} in order to extract the
